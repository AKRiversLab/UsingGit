# Create a new repo on GitHub (https://github.com/new).
# I recommend using a private repo, a Creative Commons license, and not adding a README or gitignore.
# Instead, create a README and gitignore locally, then push those to GitHub.
# Usually easier to make the repo name without spaces or special characters.
# Typing a brief repo description is also a nice touch, as is adding Topics (e.g., "r") after creating the repo.

# Locally, in GitBash, initialize git repository (only need to do this the first time).
git init

# Add the remote GitHub repository (only need to do this the first time).
# Specify path based on your GitHub profile and desired repo name (repo already created in GitHub).
git remote add origin https://github.com/jmuehlbauer-usgs/FloodRecovery.git

# Pull from GitHub repository (if there's newer stuff on GitHub--often the license file)
git pull origin main
# If you get an error here, type instead:
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Add files to commit (add file or folder names after "add", separated by spaces, or all -A).
git status
git add -A

# Delete files, if desired (add file or folder names after "rm", separated by spaces).
git rm

# Commit the changes (Write a short message explaining what you changed after "-m", in quotes).
# Standard practice for the first commit i sfor the message to be "Initial commit."
git commit -a -m "Initial commit."

# Push committed changes to GitHub
git push origin main
